### CODE REVIEW

A code review involves quality assurance on a particular project by reviewing its source code and output. This is highly important to the success of computer science professionals, since it ensures a level of consistency in the development of a project and allows for a higher level of coding standards to be met.

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

The first artifact of this portfolio is the Travlr Getaways Travel Booking Website, originally developed as part of the CS465 Full Stack Development course. This project is a comprehensive web application that allows users to browse and book travel packages. It includes features for user authentication, trip management, and booking functionalities.

#### Description of Enhancement
I refactored the code to implement a modular, component-based architecture using Angular. This involved creating a new TripDetailsComponent to handle the display of individual trip details, improving code modularity and maintainability. The TripCardComponent was updated to utilize the new TripDetailsComponent, simplifying its role to a higher-level component that delegates specific tasks to dedicated components.

## Professional Self-Assessment

My time in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University has assisted in shaping my professional goals and values. It has prepared me to become an asset to prospective employers. This ePortfolio shows my ability to plan and develop industry-standard code and software programs. Although this is not a complete reflection of my work in this program, it still depicts my knowledge in three categories: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures, and Databases.

I have gained knowledge in these categories, including several other important topics, such as collaborating in a team environment, communicating with stakeholders, and security. During the Computer Science program, I’ve completed multiple activities that involve working in a team to develop and plan the development of software. Particularly during my time in various courses, I conducted changelogs and code reviews, and communicated with stakeholders to ensure a well-rounded product. Additionally, I have experience in roles like QA, product owner, project manager, and developer. Security was another segment of my studies, where I’ve taken multiple courses that teach these concepts, including Secure Coding and Client Server Development.

**Course Outcome 1**: I employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the code review before beginning my enhancements. The code review is vital to the success of software projects, as it allows developers to fully understand which areas may be improved, alongside an in-depth analysis. This allows for organizational decision-making to be conducted properly. One enhancement that also has met this outcome is Enhancement 3: Databases. This project entailed a MongoDB database that allows for building a collaborative environment in which data may be entered and analyzed easily, even by those without programming experience.

**Course Outcome 2**: I designed, developed, and delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing Enhancement 1: Software Engineering and Design. This project heavily relies on a front-end design that, since it is meant for a business, should be professionally developed with both an appropriate design and professionally written content. It is visually coherent and technically sound in that the front-end and back end work seamlessly to provide a pleasant and easy experience to the customer.

**Course Outcome 3**: I designed and evaluated computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices by completing Enhancement 2: Algorithms and Data Structures. For this project, I enhanced the search functionality with advanced search algorithms for better performance. This project used algorithmic techniques to improve the efficiency and user experience of the search functionality.

**Course Outcome 4**: I demonstrated an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals by completing Enhancement 1: Software Engineering and Design. For this enhancement, I built and enhanced a travel booking website where users can search and book travel packages. This outcome was met because both a backend and frontend were developed, which required full-stack knowledge to complete the project, from working with Angular, Node.js, and MongoDB. The innovative techniques used in this project include a responsive website and advanced search algorithms.

**Course Outcome 5**: I developed a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources by completing Enhancement 3: Databases. Since this project works with data, it was imperative to ensure security measures were in place. The MongoDB integration includes security practices to protect data and ensure only authorized access.
